### How to run phase 4 web app
1) Install XAMPP https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
This is a good download guide:

-own-local-test-server/
2) Copy and paste "Atlanta Movie" file into C:\xampp\htdocs
3) Start Apache and MySQL in the XAMPP Control Panel
4) Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ to launch phpMyAdmin
5) You should be able to see all your local databases on the left hand
side. If not, you might need to fix it
6) Go to server.php in your Atlanta Movie file to change the name of the
database
so that it'll match with your local database. You might also need to
change the
variable names. My var names come from phase-2 create table, so some of
them are
not up to date yet.
7) Go to http://localhost/Atlanta%20Movie/ to launch the web app

Below are some of the screenshots of the application:
